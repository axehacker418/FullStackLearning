⚛️ React JS – Structured Notes
1️⃣ What is React?

React JS is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPA).

It is component-based

Developed and maintained by Facebook (Meta)

Focuses only on the UI layer

👉 React is not a full framework

2️⃣ Component-Based Architecture

React breaks a complete web application into small, reusable components.

Principle:

Write once, use everywhere

Example components:

Header

Footer

Navbar

Button

Card

Each component:

Has its own logic

Has its own UI

Can be reused multiple times

✅ Improves:

Code reusability

Maintainability

Readability

3️⃣ React: Library vs Framework
🔹 React is a Library

Handles only UI

Flexible

You choose other tools as needed

🔹 Angular is a Framework

Complete solution

Built-in routing, HTTP, forms

Opinionated structure

Feature	React	Angular
Type	Library	Framework
Routing	External	Built-in
Flexibility	High	Low
Learning Curve	Easier	Steeper
4️⃣ External Libraries in React

React does not include everything by default.

We install extra libraries when needed:

Feature	Library
Routing	react-router-dom
State Management	Redux / Zustand
HTTP Requests	Axios
Styling	Tailwind / MUI

Example:

npm install react-router-dom

5️⃣ Tools Required for React Development
🔹 Node.js

Required to run React tools

Comes with npm

🔹 Nodemon ❌ (Not required for React)

Used for backend (Node.js)

React uses hot reload automatically

👉 Correct tools:

Node.js

npm / npx

Code Editor (VS Code)

6️⃣ npm vs npx
🔹 npm (Node Package Manager)

Used to install packages

Packages stay in node_modules

Example:

npm install react

🔹 npx (Node Package Executor)

Runs packages without installing globally

Best for creating React apps

Example:

npx create-react-app myApp


✅ Advantage:

No global installation needed

Always uses latest version

7️⃣ Props vs State (VERY IMPORTANT)
🔹 Props (Properties)

Used to pass data from parent to child

Read-only

Cannot be changed by child

Example:

<Child name="React" />

🔹 State

Used to manage component’s own data

Mutable

Changes cause re-render

Example:

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

Feature	Props	State
Scope	Parent → Child	Inside component
Mutable	❌ No	✅ Yes
Re-render	❌	✅
8️⃣ Types of Components
🔹 Functional Components (Modern & Recommended)

Simple JavaScript functions

Use Hooks

Less code

function Hello() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}

🔹 Class Components (Old)

Use ES6 classes

More complex

Uses lifecycle methods

class Hello extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello</h1>;
  }
}


👉 Hooks replaced class components

9️⃣ Virtual DOM (Important Concept)

React uses a Virtual DOM:

Lightweight copy of real DOM

Updates only changed parts

Improves performance

🔟 Key Advantages of React

Fast rendering

Reusable components

Strong community

SEO friendly (with SSR)

Large job market

🎯 Interview One-Line Summary

React is a component-based JavaScript library used to build fast and reusable user interfaces using a virtual DOM.
